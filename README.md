# FullSteamAheadChat-Starter

A starter NodeJs chat application to help students learn some basic programming concepts.

Students will learn:

* Coding environment and setup
* Client-side vs Server-side code
* Website styling - HTML, CSS, Javascript
* Code hosting and deployment
* Enhancements

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* The latest stable version of NodeJs <https://nodejs.org/en/>
* A code editor, such as Visual Studio code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
* A website hosting environment, such as Microsoft Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/>

### Installing

Download (or clone) the sample application.

```Github
<https://github.com/bmudryk/FullSteamAheadChat-Starter>
```

If downloading, extract the downloaded .zip file to a folder on your c:/ drive (or wherever you prefer).  Open the FullSteamAheadChat-Starter folder using Visual Studio Code.  Normally, you would install javascript code dependencies by typing npm install from the terminal window.  This command generates the node_modules folder in the project and fills it with javascript coded by others.  For speed of this class, I have included the node_modules folder in the project repo.

```Node
npm install
```

Let's run it!  From the Terminal Window in Visual Studio Code, type the following command to start the application.

```Node
npm run start
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Enhancement Ideas

* Broadcast when someone joins or leaves the chat
* Remember session chat information
* Create a login/password
* Multiple chat rooms
* Fancy CSS and animations
